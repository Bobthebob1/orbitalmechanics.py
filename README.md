This calculator will allow you to calculate the orbital elements of a satellite or object orbiting any of the 8 planets, the sun, or Earth's moon. The orbital elements that can be calculated include:
Orbital velocity at a specified altitude, apoapsis, and periapsis
Orbital period of a circular orbit at specified altitude and of an eccentric orbit with specified apoapsis and periapsis
Escape velocity at specified altitude
Gravitational force acting on an object at a specified altitude
Gravitational potential energy of an object at a specified altitude
Specific orbital energy at a specified altitude
Semi-major axis
Delta-V required to get to a geostationary orbit from specified altitiude
Delta-V required for inclination change
Delta-V required for hohmann transfer from specified orbit, eccentric or circular. 
True anomaly given a mean anomaly
Eccentricity

Not added yet: Right ascension of ascending node, argument of perigee, initial inclination of an orbit

Please leave any suggestions in the comments below and I will try to respond. This is still a work in progress.
